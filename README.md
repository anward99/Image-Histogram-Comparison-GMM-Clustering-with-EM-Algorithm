# Image-Histogram-Comparison-GMM-Clustering-with-EM-Algorithm
This assignment is divided into two tasks.

Task 1 involves selecting two similar images, plotting their histograms, and quantitatively comparing their distributions using statistical divergence metrics including Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cross-Entropy, KL-Divergence, and JS-Divergence.

Task 2 requires generating a 3D dataset with three clusters and applying the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The process includes visualizing at least two intermediate steps of the E and M phases during clustering.
